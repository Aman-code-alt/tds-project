      "text: \"<question>Analyze the sales data in the provided image \\'sales_chart.png\\'. It includes a table of sales amounts and volumes by salesperson, along with a corresponding bar and line chart.\\n\\nAnswer the following questions and respond with a JSON array of strings containing the answer.\\n\\n1. How many salespeople have a sales amount over $500?\\n2. Which salesperson has the highest sales volume?\\n3. What\\'s the correlation between the sales amount and sales volume?\\n4. Draw a scatterplot of sales amount (x-axis) and sales volume (y-axis) along with a dotted red regression line through it.\\n   Return as a base-64 encoded data URI, `\\\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG...\\\"` under 100,000 bytes.</question>\\n        I know nothing about data analytics. To solve my question, follow this exact process:\\n\\n        ### Step 1:\\n        I will give you a question statement with possible data sources (URL, CSV, database, etc.).  \\n        Your first task: generate code that extracts **basic info** about the data source:\\n        - URL \u2192 Scrape and summarize tables, headings, and important structures. Keep summary under 100 tokens.\\n        - CSV/Excel \u2192 Return first 3 rows.\\n        - Database \u2192 Show table names or schema preview.\\n        - PDF/Text/Image \u2192 Extract a small preview (not full content).\\n\\n        ### Step 2:\\n        Download or extract the required data and save it in uploads/2be4baa2-f361-4879-8eda-05d89ac395dd.\\n\\n        ### Step 3:\\n        I will pass you the collected info from uploads/2be4baa2-f361-4879-8eda-05d89ac395dd/metadata.txt.  \\n        Then, generate code to solve the question fully and save the **final answer** in uploads/2be4baa2-f361-4879-8eda-05d89ac395dd/result.txt (or result.json if the format is structured).\\n\\n        ### Step 4:\\n        I will give you the content of uploads/2be4baa2-f361-4879-8eda-05d89ac395dd/result.txt.  \\n        - If correct \u2192 mark `run_this=0`.  \\n        - If wrong \u2192 provide corrected code to recompute the answer.  \\n\\n        ### Error Handling:\\n        If I give you an error message:\\n        - Fix the exact issue and return corrected code.\\n        - If the error repeats, generate entirely new code.\\n\\n        ### Output Format:\\n        You must always answer in **valid JSON** like this:\\n        {\\n            \\\"code\\\": \\\"<python_code_here>\\\",\\n            \\\"libraries\\\": [\\\"list\\\", \\\"of\\\", \\\"external_libraries\\\"],\\n            \\\"run_this\\\": 1 or 0\\n        }\\n\\n        ### Additional Rules:\\n        - Save extracted info into uploads/2be4baa2-f361-4879-8eda-05d89ac395dd/metadata.txt (append mode).  \\n        - Save final answers in uploads/2be4baa2-f361-4879-8eda-05d89ac395dd/result.txt (or uploads/2be4baa2-f361-4879-8eda-05d89ac395dd/result.json if structured).  \\n        - Always prepend file access with uploads/2be4baa2-f361-4879-8eda-05d89ac395dd/filename.  \\n        - Use only necessary pip-installable external libraries.  \\n\\n        Example Output: if asked to send a JSON like this:\\n        [\\\"What is the meadian of data\\\", \\\"What is mean\\\", \\\"provide base64 image\\\"]\\n\\n        Then, send result like this:\\n\\n        [20, 25, \\\"base64 image  url here\\\"]\\n        I mean don\\'t send answers like key:answer, unless it is specified.\\n        - All the uploaded files will be in the folder uploads/2be4baa2-f361-4879-8eda-05d89ac395dd. You can access them like this uploads/2be4baa2-f361-4879-8eda-05d89ac395dd/filename.\\n        \"\n"
